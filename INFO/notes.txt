---> create a local server using python 

from: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server

Open your command prompt (Windows)/terminal (OS X/Linux). To check Python is installed, enter the following command:

python -V

This should return a version number. If this is OK, navigate to the directory that your example is inside, using the cd command.

# include the directory name to enter it, for example
cd Desktop
# use two dots to jump up one directory level if you need to
cd ..

Enter the command to start up the server in that directory:

# If Python version returned above is 3.X
python -m http.server
# If Python version returned above is 2.X
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

By default, this will run the contents of the directory on a local web server, on port 8000. You can go to this server by going to the URL localhost:8000 in your web browser. Here you'll see the contents of the directory listed â€” click the HTML file you want to run.

Note: If you already have something running on port 8000, you can choose another port by running the server command followed by an alternative port number, e.g. python -m http.server 7800 (Python 3.x) or python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7800 (Python 2.x). You can then access your content at localhost:7800.
